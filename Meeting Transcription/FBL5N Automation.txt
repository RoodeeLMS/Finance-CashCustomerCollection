  00:00 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: High สิคะ
00:01 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: ฮ

00:17 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: EE OK.
00:19 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: So in brief, if you can tell what is the scope you need, not explain in detail, but exactly we know you're going to take a download, then what are you going to do further with that? I can just explain.
00:31 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Sure. No more. You want to walk through or I can. Let me do that. OK. So OK. So actually the concept is that we will download the customer live item and then locate it in the SharePoint.
00:44 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Mm-hmm.
00:47 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah, and yeah, the SharePoint. So since the five UP download daily right? So that will be the the fight every day. So the plan is that we would like to have the file breakdown by month, the year, year, year end, month. Yes, and this is the example of the file that that the team that the business they manually download from the FBL 5N right. So you will see that this is this is just the FBL, FBL fight in. However when they try to download from the FBL 5.
01:11 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Mm.
01:20 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Ish, right? So let me open up this one. So this So this is the format that we get from the FBL 5H It doesn't look it. It doesn't look look like proper like in. It doesn't look in in order. However I confirm with Shamik, he said that actually the the the T code work fine, but probably the format of the Excel or something that that's why we see the we we see the we see the the information like this and this. Is not a big problem, but actually this is something that we would like to get the final file.
01:53 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Mm-hmm.
01:57 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Right. Yeah, in like in, in, in this table. After that, after that, the five will be download to the power app. This is the schedule time that we plan. Actually we can set this solid solid timeline that the e-mail from the power app will be sent out no later than 8:00 AM. So we step back. What the what the Sep should be executed file. So we set at about 7:00 AM, but it could be fixable from 7:00 to 7:30. So after that five, we'll place as a SharePoint and then the power app will load the file to generate the e-mail.
02:28 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Yep.
02:34 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: So Power app will read the file from the SharePoint. You need to say.
02:37 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yes, lead to five from the chamoy. Yeah, connection connect. Is that right? It will read the file from the SharePoint or it will download the file from the SharePoint into the power app. I'm not sure.
02:48 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: It read files from a SharePoint and then generate the data with role account to it and then we process it to the data was e-mail and then we send the. Our automate we send the e-mail, yeah.
03:02 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: OK. So how you are planning to load the file into the SharePoint first from the SAP side?
03:07 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: From.
03:10 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: From, from, from, from the we, we plan to set the schedule job to load the flight to load the flight from SEV to SharePoint, but we want it to be automate.
03:10 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: What?
03:20 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: I'm not sure about the the solution to do so. This is what what what we would like to. We would like to consult with you We would like to consult with you. How? How could we have defy? Please at the SharePoint. Please at the SharePoint
03:33 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: See the plan.
03:34 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah, we. I think we can download the file into the folder, but we need the file moving from the folder into the SharePoint.
03:42 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: No, no. But why will the SharePoint power automate can? Can connect with any of the market endpoint also right? Can connect with any of the market endpoint Because with SharePoint the issue is that somebody has to maintain this one OK all the time and the moment you automate this process. OK, so in order to write a file to the SharePoint, an oath has to be activated here.
03:59 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Mm-hmm.
04:07 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: And if someone and it's like they will try to, they will verify the site everyone year. If somebody does not verify during that time then the site will be deleted.
04:15 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Mm-hmm.
04:16 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: So then it will create an issue.
04:18 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: So are are you saying it that? Are you saying that we want we will download the file into the share folder and have the power app rethink the file from the SharePoint share folder instead of the SharePoint clone?
04:29 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Correct, correct. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
04:33 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Is that possible that we use a share folder instead or is that any limitation that that that we can that we have to use the SharePoint?
04:40 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: Where where does a share folder located again?
04:44 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Do you have to example now we We do have to example of the shared folder because our developer actually is not Nestle employee, so I'm not sure if he has access or we have to grant access to specific share folder for him.
04:58 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: So you can take help from any of the highlight endpoint, right?
04:59 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah Yeah.
05:04 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Thailand market market server will be there.
05:05 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yes.
05:05 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: The local IT. Your local IT somebody is there from your itit.
05:08 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Uh. Uh. Alright. No miss, I'm at IT. No me
05:12 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Pure it who handles user IDs? No, no, no, it doesn't. Technology like who handle servers and desktops for you on the market side. Who's your IT FRM?
05:14 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah, but.
05:19 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: The servers that come.
05:26 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: If you worried about the maintain been maintained of the SharePoint site itself, I I look after that site anyway. So because the site will be used by multiple apps anyway. Is that what you're concerned about Is that what you're concerned about?
05:42 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: No, no, the site cannot be link for each and every app. That endpoint has to be activated. OK. It's not like that. Once one application activate, it's another will consume using the same credentials. That's not allowed in SLA.
05:58 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: You must be having LH servers there, right?
06:02 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: I'm not sure.
06:06 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: But but actually we we have other application that also pick up the file from directly from from the SharePoint. So I think that's why the developer prefer to have the the file from like the same source of the same source like the format of the SharePoint not not the share folder but. Uh.
06:29 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: I I got this market end point for the Thailand market. So just have a look at this.
06:30 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: So. Yep.
06:34 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: There will be something definitely all your interfaces with SAP, the downloads or order processing from the customer service side. They will all be using this server.
06:47 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yep, let me share this. Probably this is the folder that that example that I have for the the team information. This is a shared folder right in the.
07:01 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: No, no, this is your local one, right? OneDrive for individual, yeah.
07:04 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah. This is a local 1.
07:06 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Actually this is yeah, this the local. So what? What what we have to do? I probably I because I saved the. That's why it's showing OneDrive. OK. I don't have then.
07:20 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: So Naveen has put it on the chat. The server name he has put there.
07:25 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: OK.
07:27 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: So your IT team will know about the server.
07:30 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: IT IT team like the platform IT or who in the IT.
07:34 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Yes, yes.
07:36 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Ah.
07:37 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Thing is, will be there right in the SharePoint. I don't mean like how you people are planning for the housekeeping and all these things.
07:39 Nithijarernariya,Russarin,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: Oh.
07:44 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: So So what is?
07:44 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: 8.
07:46 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: What is the limitation that we have to fight in in into the SharePoint instead of the inside of the share folder?
07:51 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: The point is simple means like somebody has to recertify the keep on recertifying the certified time and again OK.
07:58 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah, but but that one if that one is not the conserve, we could do that.
08:02 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: And then how you're going to archive the data from the SharePoint?
08:03 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: So. Hmm.
08:10 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: Well, do we need to do that? Like do we need to just like delete every five year or something?
08:18 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Don't know the Don't know the market has to take a call from there, right? Because the data cannot be. Because it's finance data, right?
08:24 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yes, so so so so if.
08:24 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah, it's a huge data is big, right?
08:27 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah. So, so if we have the attention, yeah, the lead engine guideline to delete information every every five or ten year according to the retention guideline and is that OK?
08:27 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: It's huge data every day.
08:39 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: No, that's fine. That's fine. That's fine. So all you have to do is that you will have to create a. It's like a set point site which you have created. OK, ask Microsoft Team 360 team to.
08:49 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yes. Mm-hmm.
08:54 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Enable the auth endpoint here. Make it API enabled so that any middleware can place a file there. Then it can be automated.
09:02 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: And it will be OK. So so this one I have I have to do or or KK your team could do for us?
09:04 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Yeah Yeah.
09:13 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: No, this is not a functional thing.
09:13 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Set.
09:16 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: Your IT team a lot to do. I mean, as I told nobody is there.
09:16 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Somebody should be the functional owner for this particular site.
09:20 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: OK.
09:20 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: I don't know who's.
09:21 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: So you OK, can you provide the instruction and then I will connect with the with the local IT.
09:23 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Yeah, I can provide that. Yeah, I can provide all this information. Yeah. Yeah, like.
09:29 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: OK, so so that I understand that that would be two step right. The first step it will be your team to download the file and place it in the.
09:42 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: SoC SoC means like SAP, bad jobs will be there which will keep on downloading the files to the G data path on ASAP server itself.
09:46 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Eh. OK. OK.
09:51 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: OK. Then what will happen that with the help of a middleware, OK the file will be picked from those G data paths from the SAP system.
09:56 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: And you.
09:59 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: And it will be transferred to the SharePoint so these are
10:01 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: OK.
10:04 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: Is there two way processor two like processor?
10:06 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: And and do you know that in in like the SharePoint? Because we could split in the year end month or it will be set up in in one folder?
10:11 Kumar,Naveen,IN-Bangalore,IT Analytics Data & Integration: No means like in one folder. We can put it there and then. Or maybe it means like each year you can. Will have to dynamically. We'll have to see means like if we can dynamically decide that folder or not. Otherwise everything will be placed in a single folder.
10:31 Chamnong,Nick,TH-Bangkok,Information Technology: Yeah, we can work with that.
10:34 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: OK.

14:04 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: No, no, that's not your your bad job. That's what your variant should already pick for all customers, right? Irrespective of new customers.
14:10 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: No, not all the customer we have. We yeah, we we have to set of the customer that that we want the job to run.

14:41 Velu,Kandakumar,IN-Bangalore,IT Finance & Legal: We have to re check your variant is not using any customer list. Then it should pick for all.
14:45 Arayasomboon,Chalitda,TH-Bangkok,IT Finance & Legal: Yeah, we have the list of the customer and probably we will have the movement. But if even if not that often, but we will have to movement like every. Probably Probably I Probably I don't have to do customer. We have to add into the customer account here. OK.
